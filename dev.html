        As of Aug 2025 I just accidentally deleted my entire Unreal Engine project with the shock rifle.  It was an issue with trying to save the project, ironically.  I tried to use git and github large file storage and it replaced my files with pointers to files that are not saved anywhere so the whole thing got destroyed and I was trying to clear disk space so I deleted all my backups thinking git would help me but it hurt me instead.  It was my fault and a learning experience.

        Just made a <a href="https://primewords-1ad95f96dc03.herokuapp.com/">little anagram finder app</a> I call it Prime Words.

        Been also working on <a href="https://reviewandme.netlify.app">a social review app</a> book review app with Next.JS / React and Mongo Database.

        I think a dev log might be a good idea for my current projects.  I basically have 3.

        Project #1 is this website, it's not perfect, but I still do most of my coding on this site even though I want to get better at using React features with Next.js.  I'm currently happy with the site as is!
    </p>
    <p>
        I just revamped the <a href="projects.html">/projects</a> page and I'm really happy with it.

        Project #2 is the continued development of my backend skillset.  I've been using React and Next.js, as well as Node.js and Express, and I'm thinking of getting back into Python / Django.  Check out my React App called <a target="_blank" href="https://reviewandme.netlify.app/">"Review and Me"</a>

        Project #3 is my Unreal Engine projects.  I am currently working on the Shock Rifle demo, and I just added A.I. enemies today that follow you around.  I also have some other Unreal Projects in Third Person like one you can toggle Ghost Mode and go through walls and floors and ceilings, or one with attack animations and coin collection, magic carpets and teleportation.  I'm definitely getting better at Unreal and that's really cool.   But both Next.js and Unreal Engine are tough because they're industry standard and top of the line.  It's a lot to handle for a solo dev.  This is currently being worked on!
    </p>
    <p>
        Just go to <a href="unreal/index.html">/unreal </a> for my latest demo of this project.  I accidentally deleted it so their won't be any more updates and now I have to decide if I'm going to make a completely different game.

        I just started using Sora to make a trailer for my game.  My goal is to make a shippable demo.  I got promoted at work and I'm a Senior Test Technician and a line lead at the local supercomputer factory.  I've written this at different times but now I'm in a lawsuit with AMD and ZT and I no longer work there.  They are co-defendants.

        Enjoy that goofy trailer I made with iMovie template and Sora and some clips of my game developing.
